# Rectangle_Area

hi there

I'm really just trying to understand better the idea of Functions. I'm having really a hard time trying to understand this deepcrazy language, but I'm sure it'll be worth it, even if I'm old and dumb. Hey I wanted to be a race car driver, but there's no real perspective for me to do that so hell why not a programmer. Blockchain stuff. By the time I actually learn it it might become useless, but nonetheless I shall try.
Thanks.

Oh. Sorry. I forgot readme was supposed to talk about the program.

Simple Rust based program to calculate the area of a rectangle and also show the inputs. Really, that's all, I'm sorry. I'm trying, okay?
